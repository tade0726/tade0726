### Hi there 👋

I'm Ted Zhao, a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in the field. I specialize in recommendation systems, computer vision, and Python backend development. I have a strong background in delivering end-to-end ML solutions using Databricks/Spark, Docker, and Python.

🔭 I'm currently working on a research project on quantitative trading with reinforcement learning at The University of Adelaide.

🌱 I have a strong skill set in programming languages such as Python, VBA, Scala, and Julia. I'm also well-versed in web development and web scraping using Django, Flask, asyncio, and Scrapy.

👯 I'm looking to collaborate on machine learning and data science projects, particularly in the areas of recommendation systems, computer vision, and natural language processing.

💬 Feel free to ask me about my work experiences, which include developing and improving recommendation systems, designing and implementing data pipelines, and conducting AB tests for various applications.
